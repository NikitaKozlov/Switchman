# Contributing to Switchman

Thank you for your interest in Switchman. Your contributions are highly welcome, 
but please keep in mind that this is a repo with code example, so the main goal is to keep 
the idea as clear as possible, while covering reasonable amount of edge cases. 

There are two ways to contribute:

## File a bug
We don't have a goal to cover all the edge cases, because some of them are domain-specific that 
could reduce clarity of the main idea. Although if we missed something important feel free to 
create an issue. Writing a test that reproduces the bug is very much appreciated.

## Add a new test
Coding against tests could be a lot of fun, so having tests that covers more edge cases, even if 
they already covered by the solution code is always a good thing. 
 
## Contributing the code
This is a rough outline of what the workflow for code contributions looks like:
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Create a topic branch from master.
- Use standard Android Studio formatting and try to keep the same style as the code around.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Write good commit messages.
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request.
- Your pull request must receive a :thumbsup: from one of the Maintainers.

Thanks for your contributions!
